Evolve plug-ins
===============

These are plug-ins I wrote for Evolve. Some of them might be useful to you (for example: *world rope removal*), some may not (for example: *reauth*).

Either way you're free to use these for learning purposes or on your server (although a bit of credit would be much appreciated).

## Why is ev_framework.lua in here?
That's simple, I made some changes to the framework so you can ban people for 9001 centuries, instead of "forever" (which is lame).
You can ask git (or any other comparison program) to tell you the difference.


## Anything about the license?
For these plug-ins the same license applies as (for this repository)[/LICENSE].

Enjoy them!
