Evolve plug-ins
===============

These are plug-ins I wrote for Evolve. Some of them might be useful to you (for example: *world rope removal*), some may not (for example: *reauth*).

Either way you're free to use these for learning purposes or on your server (although a bit of credit would be much appreciated).

Enjoy them!
