## Wunt sum answer? ##
Here's a quick FAQ

### Will you accept merge requests ###
Yeah, if I think the quality of what you merged is good enough, I'll merge it.

### Can you make me a contributer to your addons on the Workshop? ###
If I accepted your merge request you can send me a message here (on GitHub) or via [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/roelof)(Just toss it on my profile) and I'll (try to) add you as a contributor.

### Did you make other stuff? ###
Yeah, I might upload that later (here and on workshop).

### Awww man, thanks. Now shut up and take my money ###
[That would be very much appreciated!](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2EA9Y7XFEFSZ4)
